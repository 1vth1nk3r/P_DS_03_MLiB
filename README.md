# Predicting the volume of oil reserves for new wells
The project from the Machine Learning in Business sprint of the Practicum DS course.

## Description
Here we have a dataset on geological exploration data for the OilyGiant mining company. Our goal is to build a model for finding the best place for a new well based on the predicted volume of reserves.

First, we should do some data preprocessing: clean the data, fill in the missing values (if any), and change data types. Next, we need to scale and encode the data. Afterward, we could proceed to models development.

## Conclusion
Using some geological exploration data, we built a Linear Regression model to predict the volume of reserves for the region. Estimating the average profit from the 200 best wells for the region and the risk of losses, we could assume that the best place for new wells would be Region 1.
